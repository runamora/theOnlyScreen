The screens are the first thing we see when we wake up and the last thing we check before going to bed. In an effort to reclaim 100% human spaces, we built a DIY (do it yourself) electronic object that performs the only action preventing us from permanently removing screens from the room. This artwork is an invitation for you to create your own alarm clock using electronic manufacturing technology.
